I tried my best to implement step by step what I learned during the classes on my project.

I have created a tattoo site that has three pages.

1- Home

2-Gallery 

3-Sign up 

<ul id="menu">
        <li><a href="signup.html" class="active">Sign up</a></li>
        <li><a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a></li>
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>

My project has three files that I have given the design content to css.

#circle-cover-bg {
    background: url('../images/tat-image.jpg') no-repeat center center;
    height: 300px;
    width: 300px;
    border-radius: 50%;}

I also saved various photos on my computer desktop and used them in the project.

I have worked with 3 different HTML files in the project because my site has 3 pages.

        <li><a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a></li>

I had a little problem with the second file because the second page wouldn't open for several hours and then I managed to do it carefully on the ID.
I was using the terminal all the time and I opened a new terminal at the beginning of the project.
git add .
git commit-m ""
git push 
and this is how I added the contect.
I didn't get help from anyone during the entire and I tried to do the solutions myself.
I think I will be more successful in the next project.
Thanks
